## Springboard Capstone Project #1: Deep Demographic Insights from Amazon Customer Data

### Introduction
Businesses are constantly seeking new customers to purchase their products. They attempt to attract these customers by way of a discipline called marketing. But the questions at the forefront of the minds of any marketer are: who should I market to, and how? There are many ways to approach these questions, but statistical data analytics can often generate insights that even the most seasoned marketer may miss. As an entrepreneur myself, I would find these insights extremely valuable for my own business; so, for my first capstone project, I have chosen to perform analytics on our own Amazon customer data to generate marketing insights. Specifically, I plan to explore the demographics of our current customer base in order to determine better who to target with our marketing and which messages may resonate more soundly with them.
